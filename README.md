## ConigCare Mobile Application
 Bridge the communication gap for non-verbal individuals

#### Backend -

The CogniCare App is a revolutionary tool designed to empower non-verbal individuals, particularly those who are deaf and dump, to communicate effectively in public places. By converting text input into sign language animations in real-time, the app eliminates the need for a translator and enables users to express themselves independently. Additionally, the app includes a comprehensive learning platform with interactive resources and vocabulary expansion exercises to support users in improving their sign language skills. With its user-friendly interface and focus on accessibility, the app promotes inclusivity and empowerment in communication for non-verbal individuals.
